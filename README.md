The line UI is a Components Library for Flutter ecosystem, based on the idea of animating lines, focusing on clean Interfaces where movement is the one who tells the message.

## TODO

- Add colors for `Spinner`.
- `Button`s disabled state (`onPressed` = null)
- `MultiSelector` with Animations.
- animate `LinearInput` Label.

## Tech debt

- Refactor `Spinner` impl. 
- Review `Button`s animations design & colors, fix color memoization.
- `LinearInput` labels, add bottom option, and remove hardcoded `Position` offset.
